# project-mantyekins
A simple GameBoy emulator written in C++

Currently very work-in-progress, with focus on ensuring CPU and cartridge emulation primarily.

There is no deliverable as of now. 

Just like my CHIP-8 emulator, the eventual goal is to use SDL2 for rendering.

This is my first project that aims to follow a directory structure and use a build system [currently considering CMake], and so special considerations have been made in that regard.

Project was rewritten to allow for certain improvements in CPU emulation, this currently is sitting in teetris.cpp
